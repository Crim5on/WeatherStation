# Embedded Weather Station
Weather station feauturing the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity. Integration of a 2x16 LCD display is planed. Should support Arduino Uno as well as STM32 Nuclueo boards.





# Components

##DHT11

* Supply voltage (VDD): 3V3 - 5V5
* Supply current: 0.3mA while measuring, 60uA while in standby
* 2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)
* Humidity range: 20 - 80% with 5% accuracy
* Temperature range: 0 - 50°C with ±2°C accuracy
* Sampling period: every 1 second
* dimesions: 15.5mm x 12mm x 5.5mm - (0.1" pin spacing)



##DHT22

* Supply voltage (VDD): 3V3 - 5V5
* Supply current: 2.5mA while measuring
* Humidity range: 0 - 100% with 2-5% accuracy
* Temperature range: -40 - 125°C with ±0.5°C accuracy
* Sampling period: every 2 seconds
* dimesions: 15.1mm x 25mm x 7.7mm - (0.1" pin spacing)
